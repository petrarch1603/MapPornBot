#Voting

*  The entries for this year's contest are posted in the comments below.
*  The thread is shown in **contest mode** until the voting is over. This means the maps will be presented in random order, vote counts will be secret and comments on posts are hidden by default.
*  Be sure to go through all the submissions!
*  Upvote as many maps as you'd like.
*  Remember you're voting for **good, quality maps.** Consider the amount of effort that went into the map, the aesthetics, level of detail and content of the map.
*  You may comment on the maps but **do not post top level comments**, these comments will be removed. If you want to comment on the contest, there will be a comment thread for general discussion.
*  Anonymity is part of the fun, so revealing that a submission is yours will result in a disqualification. After voting is over, submitters are encouraged to claim their maps and we will announce the top maps. The winner will get special flair.
*  %NUMBERSUBMITTED% maps submitted this month.
*  Voting ends on %ENDDATE% at 9PM Eastern US time.
